# Etch-A-Sketch Project

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Etch-A-Sketch toy, created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to create a grid of squares and color in individual squares by hovering the mouse over them.

# What I Learned

## HTML & CSS

I learned how to create a grid using div elements and CSS flex properties. This involved creating a container div and then filling it with child divs using JavaScript to represent each square of the Etch-A-Sketch grid.

I further enhanced my understanding of CSS properties such as display, flex-wrap, flex, width, and height. I also learned how to make a smooth transition effect using transition, transform, and box-shadow.

## JavaScript

I developed a deeper understanding of JavaScript DOM manipulation. I learned how to create, modify, and append elements to the DOM dynamically.

I learned how to add event listeners to elements, specifically the 'mouseover' event to create the drawing effect.

I used nested for loops to create a grid of div elements.

I implemented the functionality to reset the grid and create a new one based on user input.

## Debugging & Problem Solving

I learned the importance of breaking down larger problems into smaller, more manageable tasks.

I used the console extensively to test and debug my code.

I learned to better identify when to use certain JavaScript methods like getElementsByClassName and getElementById.
